# GitOps Overview

GitOps is a modern approach to continuous deployment that uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.

## 🔄 Core Principles

### 1. Declarative
Everything is described declaratively - the desired state of your system is versioned in Git.

### 2. Versioned and Immutable
All changes are tracked in version control, providing a complete audit trail.

### 3. Pulled Automatically
Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from Git.

### 4. Continuously Reconciled
Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.

    Dev[Developer] --> Git[Git Repository]
    Git --> ArgoCD[Argo CD]
    ArgoCD --> K8s[Kubernetes Cluster]
    ArgoCD --> Monitor[Monitoring & Alerts]
    K8s --> App[Applications]
```

## ✅ Benefits

- **Increased Productivity**: Developers can focus on code, not deployment
- **Enhanced Security**: No direct cluster access needed
- **Improved Reliability**: Automated rollbacks and consistent deployments
- **Better Compliance**: Complete audit trail of all changes
- **Faster Recovery**: Easy rollbacks to any previous state
